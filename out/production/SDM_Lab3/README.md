SDM Lab 3 - Knowledge Graphs

The .java file CosmogOntology.java defines the TBox and creates the .rdf file cosmog_tbox.rdf

The cosmog_tbox.rdf file is then uploaded to a graphDB respository using the RDFS Plus inference setting.

The tbox_visual_graphdb.png image is the result of visualizing the TBox in GraphDB.
